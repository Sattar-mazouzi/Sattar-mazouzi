High-achieving master's graduate student, with an aptitude in electronic and Embedded Systems engineering, Ambitious, adaptable and always Motivated and passionate about developing electronic systems, I'm a self-taught and hard-working person with a passion to gain more, I'm seeking the opportunity to use my background in real-world experience. As I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics engineering and hold a masterâ€™s degree in Embedded Systems, As an individual who is interested in continuous professional development, Iâ€™ve gained experience in Analogue and Digital electronic designs, Power Electronics, Microcontrollers and embedded system platforms, Control System design and also have skills in object-oriented programming ( Python and C&C++), throughout my academic career I also gained oral and written communication abilities and strengthened my mathematical skills. I am looking forward to taking my skills to the next level.

Currntly toward finishing a PhD project.the research project focuses on monitoring and optimising energy management systems for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles by optimizing fuzzy logic parameters using optimization algorithms, during my research, I was working to design a comprehensive optimizable fuzzy logic inference system subjected to a specific to multi-objective constraint, although my current research seems somehow different from my past research area, I am focusing now on implementing control system and the energy management algorithm in real embedded system hardware.
